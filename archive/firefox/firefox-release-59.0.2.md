| asasaki  | 1 | [bug none](https://bugzil.la/none)        | both ryan and i reran the same repackage task, then ryan cancelled his (latest). i had to cancel the repackage-signing task, then rerun both in order. this could have forced us to do a build2 if it wasn't caught in time. we should consider moving off treeherder and into a releaseduty dashboard, and/or going with stricter handoffs | True | True |
| asasaki  | 2 | [bug none](https://bugzil.la/none)        | release-updates-builder-firefox died trying to use the v4 submitter (buildbot) | True | False |
| asasaki  | 3 | [bug none](https://bugzil.la/none)        | snap failed | True | True |
| asasaki  | 4 | [bug none](https://bugzil.la/none)        | repackages and partials continue to be flaky, requiring people to rerun tasks. if these were robust, we wouldn't have hit the double rerun conflict | True | True |
