| [bug 1448239](https://bugzil.la/1448239)  | Snap build failed: 404 when downloading libtiff5-dev_4.0.6-1ubuntu0.3_amd64.deb. Temporarilly resolved by submitting https://tools.taskcluster.net/groups/Ar8c5e3_T_iHbJlzBP56FA/tasks/az361OxlRqCRJsRkveXfmg | asasaki  | Firefox 60.0b6 |
| [bug 1445666](https://bugzil.la/1445666)  | only updated the esr52-latest* aliases, not the esr-latest* | asasaki  | Firefox 52.7.3esr |
| [bug none](https://bugzil.la/none)  | both ryan and i reran the same repackage task, then ryan cancelled his (latest). i had to cancel the repackage-signing task, then rerun both in order. this could have forced us to do a build2 if it wasn't caught in time. we should consider moving off treeherder and into a releaseduty dashboard, and/or going with stricter handoffs | asasaki  | Firefox 59.0.2 |
| [bug none](https://bugzil.la/none)  | snap failed | asasaki  | Firefox 59.0.2 |
| [bug none](https://bugzil.la/none)  | repackages and partials continue to be flaky, requiring people to rerun tasks. if these were robust, we wouldn't have hit the double rerun conflict | asasaki  | Firefox 59.0.2 |
